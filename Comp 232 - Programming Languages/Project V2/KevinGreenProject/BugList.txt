Functions may call themselves with the first argument as that function but this returns the wrong value; Believe it has something to do with how the stack handles recursive calls
Example:
> ((let (a 1) (f lambda (x y) (add x y)))(f (f 2 3) 1))
FINAL VALUE = 8.000000

Read function works just fine, has small cosmetic bug where NULL NODE RECIEVED is printed afterwards; Believe it has something to deal with how the prgram reads input
